    question: 'How do I make sure our Linen content show up at Google?',
    answer: `      
    Make sure you add links to your Linen community.
    The more links you have the more likely Google will index your content. 
    Most commonly we see users add links to their Linen instance in their landing page footer or Github repo. We see a 2-3x difference between traffic of communities who has backlinks and those who don’t.

  {
    question: 'How long does it take to get my content indexed by Google?',

    question: 'How does Linen Slack syncing work?',
    answer: `Linen will sync all conversations that it has access to. If you are on the free tier it will pull the last 90 days of history from Slack. If you are on the premium tier it will sync your entire history of conversation
      
      If you would like access to the entire history without upgrading to a premium Slack account you can download the link https://slack.com/help/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data. Then you have to upload it to our server and it will automatically pull the data. 
      
      For the file upload sync please check back after a few hours to verify if it is there. If the history isn’t there feel free to contact us at help@linen.dev

    You can then upload it under linen.dev/s/YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME/integrations
