              Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“

              on a recurring and periodic basis (“<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>

              depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
              purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
              automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
              cancel it or Rebase Corporation cancels it. You may cancel your
              Subscription renewal either through your online account management
              page or by contacting Rebase Corporation customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
              process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide
              Rebase Corporation with accurate and complete billing information
              including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number,
              and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
              information, you automatically authorize Rebase Corporation to
              charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
              such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Rebase
              Corporation will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you
              must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the
              full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on
              the invoice.

              Rebase Corporation will provide you with a reasonable prior notice
