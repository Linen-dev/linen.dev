Hey ğŸ‘‹
Quick note, I saw that there's a spelling error in the license dashboard UI:
&gt; 1 devices @ $1.00/device/month
&gt; Billed *anually* at $12.00/yr
&gt; Next payment on Apr 13, 2023
Should be *annually*.
`,
  `
https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/pull/5102 - that should take care of that. Thanks for reporting it
`,
  `
Thank you both!
