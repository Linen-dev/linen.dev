# Abstract Syntax Tree

The package contains parsers, stringifiers and utilities related to various syntaxes used in messages within linen.

The tree structure is easy to work with and simplifies the rendering process.

All parsers should generate same nodes, so we can reuse same rendering process for different message formats.
